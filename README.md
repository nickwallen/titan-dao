An attempt to communicate with Titan using whatever version of Titan might cooperate.  I have tried the following.

1. `titan 0.5.4` with `atlas-titan 0.7-incubating` - An older release of Titan used by Atlas
2. `titan 1.0.0` - The latest, stable release of Titan.
3. `titan 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT` - A [fork of Titan](https://github.com/graben1437/titan1withtp3.1) that should work with HBase 1.1.1 and Hadoop 2.7.1.  This version was built and then installed in my local maven repository.
